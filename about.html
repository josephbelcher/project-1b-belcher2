        <h2>About The Artist</h2>
        <p> Joseph Belcher fled the rock scene in Lake Charles, Louisiana as an aspiring guitarist to pursue a degree in Urban and Electronic Music Production (now Hip Hop and R&B) at Loyola University New Orleans. Drawing inspiration from artists like Kanye West, Death Grips, SOPHIE, and Oneohtrix Point Never, Belcher took on a harder hitting, digitized, and avant-garde approach to production. By producing tracks for friends and colleagues, Belcher aimed to master his craft and gain more insight into the process of sound design and recording. One could describe Belcher's sound as avant-pop with elements of hip-hop and chiptune. He continues to hone his craft and develop his sound in efforts to release his first solo project soon.</p>
